# [Zoe's Resume] Generator
The square brackets are to distinguish it from something called "Zoe's [Resume Generator]", which would be software owned by Zoe that generates resumes. [Zoe's Resume] Generator is software of ambiguous ownership that generates Zoe's resume.

The official acronym is [RG. Because ['s pronunciation in English, when used specifically as a letter, is undefined, I've taken the creative liberty to make the official pronunciation of [RG start with [ as a finger snap. 
Of course, language belongs to the people who speak it, and while pronunciations and abbreviations endorsed by the creators of something can exist, the correct pronunciation or abbreviation of something is whatever people say and expect to be said. Unfortunately for you, I'm the only person who is *ever* going to care about [RG, meaning that 100% of the people who abbreviate [Zoe's Resume] Generator do it as [RG, and 100% of people who say [RG pronounce [ as a finger snap.
